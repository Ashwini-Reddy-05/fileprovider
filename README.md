# fileprovider
This is a simple File Uploader web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the app, including a drag-and-drop area, a button to choose files, a hidden file input, and a section to display uploaded files. The CSS file (upload.css) is used to design a clean card layout, style the upload area, and improve the overall user experience. The JavaScript file (upload.js) adds functionality by handling file selection, drag-and-drop actions, and displaying the list of uploaded files dynamically. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and file input handling in a simple and practical way.
